# DistributedHashtable
A distributed hash table has been designed in this project. It has no central server, each peer is both a server and a client. As a client, it provides interfaces through which users can issue queries  and view search results. As a server, it accepts queries from other peers, checks for matches against its local  hash  table,  and  responds  with  corresponding  results.  In  addition,  since  thereâ€™s  no  central  indexing  server,  search is done through consistent hashing.
